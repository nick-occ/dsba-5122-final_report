State departments of health and human services may find this data useful for opioid action plans. For example, the NC Department of Health and Human Services has an ongoing project called the Opioid Action Plan Implementation Initiative. They may find this data/app useful.

When forming an action plan for the opioid crisis, one question researchers and public policy officials may have is whether the drugs identified as the addictive substance and/or the cause of the overdose are drugs that can be legally prescribed, such as oxycodone or percocet, or if they are illegal drugs such as heroin. We believe the answer to this question would help them choose how to utilize resources and focus their efforts.
